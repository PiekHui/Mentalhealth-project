# üêá UniPaw - Your Digital Pet, Your Uni Life Companion

UniPaw is a mobile application designed to provide accessible mental health support for university students and promote emotional well-being through interactive features and AI assistance, helping students cope with the demands of university life.

## üîç Problem Statement

Mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and stress are increasingly prevalent globally, including those caused by academic pressure and the demands of campus life. Stigma and limited access to resources prevent many individuals from seeking necessary help. With over 280 million people affected by depression alone, there is a critical need for accessible and supportive mental wellness solutions. UniPaw aims to address this gap by offering immediate access to mental health resources, fostering daily engagement through a virtual pet companion, and bridging the path to professional care and academic support.

## üí° Solution Overview

UniPaw is a Flutter-based mobile application that serves as a digital companion with animations for mental wellness. It utilizes Firebase for backend services (data storage, authentication) and integrates Google's Gemini AI and OpenRouter for interactive chat support. Other features like a calendar planner, focus timer, peer support and consultation, and budget tracker provide more balanced academic control. What truly sets us apart is that everything you need to thrive as a student is right here, all in one app.

## Getting Started (Environment Setup)

This project is built with Flutter. To run the application locally:

1.  **Ensure Flutter is installed:** Follow the official [Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd flutter-project # Or your project directory name
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
4.  **Set up Firebase:**
    *   Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Register your Android and/or iOS app with the Firebase project.
    *   Download the `google-services.json` (for Android) and/or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) configuration files and place them in the appropriate directories (`android/app/` and `ios/Runner/`).
    *   Enable necessary Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore/Realtime Database).
5.  **Set up Google Gemini API:**
    *   Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) or Google Cloud Console.
    *   Create a new file by copying `lib/config/env.sample.dart` to `lib/config/env.dart`.
    *   Open `lib/config/env.dart` and replace the placeholder `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual Gemini API key.
    *   **Important:** The `lib/config/env.dart` file is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent your API key from being accidentally committed to version control.
6.  **Set up Google Maps API:**
    *   Obtain an API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/maps-android-backend.googleapis.com).
    *   Configure the API key in your Android (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`) and/or iOS (`ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` or `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.m`) configurations.
7.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
